# Python-Programming-Language

Python - Before you are able to start using Python to take over your programming needs, it is important to start learning more about it and all of the great benefits you will receive when using this program. Python is a high level programming tool, which means that it is easy to use and read, even as a beginner. Compared to using other popular codes, like Java and C++, this can make Python much easier to complete.

Benefits of Python In real time Environment :
1. An elegant syntax which will make the programs so easy to read.Language that is easy to use so that the program will work without a lot of bugs.

2. Has a large library that will work with other programming tasks such as changing files, searching for text, and connecting with web servers.

3. Python programming can be run on any unit including Unix, Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

4. Easy to use and read.

5. Can work with other programming languages.

Origins of Python :
The beginning of the modern Python programming started in December of 1989. The creator of this program was Guido van Ross-um who began programming as more of a hobby. 
Python has currently 2 versions :
1. Python 2
2. Python 3
Python 2.0 was released during 2000 to make it more community
oriented and to have a transparent development process. There are a few newer versions of Python 2.0 still being used, but Python 3 has been taking the world by storm and most anticipate this will be the normal one used within the next few years.

Python 3 :

This version of Python was released in 2008. It is not simply an update to the
program, but a complete change in it. While there are a lot of great features that come with this version, it doesnâ€™t have a backward compatibility so you will have to make a choice between Python 2.0 and Python 3
In Simply way there a library called as future is can be use to convert python version from Python 2 to Python 3.

Python is an object-oriented programming language created by Guido Ross um in 1989. It is ideally designed for rapid prototyping of complex applications. It has interfaces to many OS system calls and libraries and is extensible to C or C++. Many large companies use the Python programming language include NASA, Google, YouTube, BitTorrent, etc.
Python language can use for multiple platforms for web and app development as well as for Data or in Machine Learning, AI. Python is in demand after 2017. Now a days all organisation in world switch to Python or start new projects on Python.
